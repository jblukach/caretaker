Your online reputation is one of your most valuable assets. It helps you decide which websites and online services you can trust - and in some cases, it can even affect your own ability to access the internet if your connection has shown suspicious activity in the past.

Project Caretaker makes this easy. It offers a simple, transparent way for anyone to check and verify their Internet reputation against Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), just by visiting a website - helping you stay safe, trusted, and connected online.

## Reputation

### Internet Connection

When accessing [https://api.lukach.io/osint/ip](https://api.lukach.io/osint/ip) or [https://api.lukach.io/osint/ip?134.129.111.111](https://api.lukach.io/osint/ip?134.129.111.111), the result indicates whether any threat-intelligence feeds currently flag the queried IP address.

##### **Unknown**

An unknown result means no data is currently available from monitoring feeds. This does **not** guarantee that the IP is safe; it simply indicates there is no evidence at this time linking it to malicious activity.

##### **Suspect**

A suspect result indicates that one or more threat-intelligence feeds have flagged the IP address as suspect. The system will list the specific feeds, allowing for further investigation or remediation.
