Your online reputation is one of your most valuable assets. It helps you decide which websites and online services you can trust - and in some cases, it can even affect your own ability to access the internet if your connection has shown suspicious activity in the past.

Project Caretaker makes this easy. It offers a simple, transparent way for anyone to check and verify their Internet reputation against Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), just by visiting a website - helping you stay safe, trusted, and connected online.

## Reputation

### Internet Connection

When accessing [verify.tundralabs.org](https://verify.4n6ir.com), the color-coded result indicates whether any threat-intelligence sources currently flag the queried IP address.

**Gray Status - Unknown:**

A gray result means no data is presently available from monitoring sources. This should not be interpreted as a guarantee of safety; it simply indicates that there is no current evidence associating the IP with malicious activity.

**Orange Status - Suspect:**

An orange result indicates that one or more threat-intelligence sources have flagged the IP address as suspect. In this case, the system will display the specific sources, enabling further investigation or remediation.

### Sender Policy Framework

Maintaining a clean domain reputation is essential for ensuring reliable email deliverability, protecting your brand, and strengthening your overall security posture. A domain reputation review helps identify which IP addresses and domains are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain and highlights identified threat-intelligence.

When accessing [https://spf.4n6ir.com/?4n6ir.com](https://spf.4n6ir.com/?4n6ir.com) a reputation check of the 4n6ir.com sending domain is completed.
