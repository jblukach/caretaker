Your online reputation is one of your most valuable assets. It helps you decide which websites and services you can trust — and in some cases, it can even affect your own ability to access the internet if your connection has shown suspicious activity in the past.

Project Caretaker makes this easy. It offers a simple, transparent way for anyone to check and verify their internet reputation just by visiting a website — helping you stay safe, trusted, and connected online.

## TO-DO

The critical part is making the results usable by anyone with just a website visit!

The lookup completes using the Internet address your connection originates from to protect the potential sensitivity of the returned results.

We don't want to tip the hand like playing cards, losing the advantage!

If the website returns **gray**, it means there is no data currently available, but that does not mean there still could not be a problem.

When the website returns **orange**, it will list sources and last-seen timestamps of potential reputation concerns.

![Project Caretaker Suspect Alert](images/suspect.png)

When the website returns **yellow**, monitoring is not occurring.

You may require additional assistance to resolve the issue outside of this project; at least the awareness to start asking questions will exist.
